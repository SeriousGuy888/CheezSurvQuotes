# CheezSurvQuotes
skript borken so i quickly wrote this plugin in like a few minutes to replace the action bar quotes functionality

config.yml
```yml
# interval in seconds between quotes being shown
interval: 45

quotes:
  # direct url to a text file with a list of quotes
  source_url: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeriousGuy888/CheezSurv/main/quotes.txt"
  
  # what to split the text file contents by, such as a new line (\n)
  delimiter: "\n"
```
